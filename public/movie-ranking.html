<h1>Best Movies to Watch According to Mrunal!</h1>
<h2>My best 5 movies of all time from various genres-</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>This movie has the highest rating in IMDB as well, a popular movie rating platform.
   It is a classic story set in a jail, where the protagonist is serving for a falsely
   accused crime. Along the way, he sets out a new path for friendship, enemy, adventure
   and much more with his inmates. A lovely movie to watch, with fantastic roles played by
   Tim Robbins as the protagonist, alongwith Morgan Freeman in supporting role!
</p>

<h3>12 Angry Men</h3>
<p>A Black and White movie set in 1950s, with super exciting plot, 10/10 acting, and 100/100 direction.
   The plot revolves around the decision to be taken by a bench of 12 Jury, on a murder which 
   appears too simple at first glance. But the plot thickens with the movie, as the story gets 
   more complicated, revelaing the complex thought process in a decision making.

<h3>Mean Girls</h3>
<p>A hilariously comedy RomCom teen movie! And an instant mood changer, if you feel that
   you have not watched a really good comedy movie. Set in a high school in 2000s, this movie 
   explores the personal and social life of a newly moved high school student, and her way to
   friendship, jealousy, romance, and much more... Do give it a watch if you enjoy high school
   teen movies.

<h3>Gone with the wind</h3>
<p>One of the finest classic movies I have watched till date. The movie is filled with great 
   music and vivid colours. The plot revolves around the personal life of a young lady, the protagonist,
   and her clever and treacheorus art of manipulation! Movie is set in the Civil War period of America, 
   with a blend of romance and drama. Make sure to watch it in one go!!!

<h3>A Beautiful Mind</h3>
<p>A biographical movie, on the life of John Nash, who won the Noble Prize in Economics for
   his work. A truly inspiring movie directed by Ron Howard (my fav director), which delves into
   Nash's time at Princeton all the way upto his Noble Prize ceremony. It highlights 
   his everlasting ailment with Schizophernia and how he overcame it!
